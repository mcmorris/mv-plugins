# mv-plugins
RPG Maker MV plugins

This repo houses plugins I've created to extend RPG Maker MV functionality.  Care has been taken to ensure that these plugins are compatible with most other plugins.  Each script may be used independently of the others except where an inclusion is directly referenced.

Some plugins depend on Yanfly's plugins.

No build is necessary for this repo.
