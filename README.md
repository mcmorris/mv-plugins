RPG Maker MV plugins

This repo houses plugins I've created to extend RPG Maker MV functionality.  Care has been taken to ensure that these plugins are compatible with most other plugins.  Each script may be used independently.

# Requirements #
Some plugins depend on other plugins.  Plugin requirements are listed for each plugin in the header section.

# Build #
No build is necessary.

# Install #
1. To use in your own RPG Maker MV project, copy the desired plugin files to: YOUR_PROJECT_PATH/js/plugins
2. In the editor, select the plugin manager, and add the copied plugins to the project
3. Finally, configure the plugin parameters to suit your needs
